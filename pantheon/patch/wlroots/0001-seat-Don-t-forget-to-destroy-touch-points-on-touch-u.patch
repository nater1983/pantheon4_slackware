Subject: [PATCH] seat: Don't forget to destroy touch points on touch up
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Otherwise number of touch points goes up constantly and d'n'd via touch
can't work as validation always fails.

Fixes 75ecba44 ("seat: add serials to touch up events")
